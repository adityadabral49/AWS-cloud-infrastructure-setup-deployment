# AWS Cloud Infrastructure Setup & Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Python-based web application on AWS using a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure. The architecture includes a custom VPC setup with public and private subnets, EC2 for application hosting, and RDS for database management.

---

## 🚀 Architecture Components

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** with public and private subnets  
- **EC2 (Linux Instance)** for hosting the application  
- **RDS (MySQL)** for managed database in private subnet  
- **Security Groups** for controlled inbound and outbound traffic  
- **IAM Roles** for secure access management  
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring logs and performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- AWS (EC2, VPC, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch)  
- Linux (Ubuntu)  
- Python  
- Nginx

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps

1. Created a custom VPC with public and private subnets  
2. Configured Internet Gateway and routing tables  
3. Launched EC2 instance in public subnet  
4. Installed Python and deployed the application on EC2  
5. Set up RDS (MySQL) in private subnet  
6. Connected EC2 with RDS securely  
7. Configured Security Groups for access control  
8. Enabled monitoring using CloudWatch
